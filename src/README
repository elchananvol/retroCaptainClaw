I work hard on this project.
unfortunately there is no enough time to do this game challenging well.
and that what happen for the end:
i made retro to old game "captain claw" please read more detail (with images!) on README.MD .
if some reason its didn't work please go to github https://github.com/elchananvol/retroCaptainClaw
try to branch from there.
unique implementation:
i made delete in range function to delete objects that are out of the screen.
i make that tree are in the background and the avatar didn't collies with them.
i use in toolkit library to read gif images. and for this i need to use in path that start from src/pepse,
and didn't succeed another way, and its can make problem. but it run on aquarium computers when i took from my git.
in leaf class there is a lot magic numbers that determine the leaf movement in wind.
in tree class i made the tree in one block all the trunk, than in the top third and above the tree with same
 size in this part i make the leaves. for all tree i did all its leaves in unique layer so it will be ease to delete
  when the avatar are away from this area
