and that what happen for the end:
I made a retro to the old game "captain claw" please read in more detail on README.MD.
if some reason you cannot run the jur you can pull the source code from Github  https://github.com/elchananvol/retroCaptainClaw
unique implementation:
I made a delete in range function to delete objects that are out of the screen.
I made that tree in the background and the avatar didn't collide with them.
I use the toolkit library to read gif images. and for this i need to use in path that start from src/pepse,
and didn't succeed another way, and it can cause problems. but it runs on aquarium computers when I take it from my git.
In leaf class there are a lot of magic numbers that determine the leaf movement in the wind.
in tree class i made the tree in one block all the trunk, than in the top third and above the tree with same
 size in this part i make the leaves. for all tree i did all its leaves in unique layer so it will be ease to delete
  when the avatar are away from this area
i made a unique calculation so when the sun is in the center of the sky (middle day) the brightness of
 the image is at maximum.
The sky object completely disappears because it is the same color of background img, it's left only for show.
