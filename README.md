# rerto to captain claw

you start this game with 2 life,and 200 energy.
your mission is to lead Claw to 1,000,000$!

but be aware! 
there is enemy that you need to defeat!
push on control bottom to defeat enemy when you meet him and get the treasure that it preserves on.
if you loose yore energy you will be dead, but you have 2 life, ye?

when you on the floor you can jump high (press space) without moving right or left,
and you can fly (press shift + space) but it takes energy. 
also, you can go right and left, and you have counter in top left screen.

# understand?    go!

for developers: 
its base on danoGameLab that help create easy simple games.
I took images of claw from fans forums.
I use for background image of level 6 of Claw original game
music from level 1, and all characters from all levels.
