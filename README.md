# retro of captain claw
##### _fun project that I did at the Hebrew University in java class_
you start this game with 2 life, and 200 energy.
Your mission is to lead Claw to 1,000,000$!

#### But be aware!

There is an enemy that you need to defeat and take the treasure!

if you lose your energy you will be dead once, but you have 2 life, ye?

- you can go right and left and you have counters in the top left screen.
- push on the control bottom to defeat enemy while meeting and get the treasure that it preserves on.
- when you on the floor you can jump high (press space) without moving right or left
- and you can fly (press shift + space) but it takes energy.


### understood?
## go!


- it's based on danoGameLab that helps create simple games.
- I took images of claws from fan forums.
- I use the background image of level 6 of Claw original game, music from level 1, and all characters from all levels.
