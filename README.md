# Captain Claw Retro
##### _This is a fun project that I undertook at the Hebrew University as part of a Java class. The game is a retro version of the classic Captain Claw._

### Gameplay
You start the game with 2 lives and 200 energy. Your mission is to guide Claw to a treasure worth $1,000,000!

However, beware! There is an enemy that you must defeat to claim the treasure. If you lose all your energy, you will lose a life. But donâ€™t worry, you have 2 lives!

You can move Claw right and left, and you will find counters on the top left of the screen. Press the control button to defeat the enemy when you encounter them and claim the treasure they guard.

When Claw is on the ground, he can jump high (press space) without moving right or left. He can also fly (press shift + space), but this consumes energy.


### Assets
The game is based on danoGameLab, which aids in creating simple games. I sourced images of Claw from fan forums. The background image is from level 6 of the original Claw game, the music is from level 1, and the characters are from all levels.
